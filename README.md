# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
# Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a predictive model to estimate house sale prices based on various features. This model will help real estate agents, potential buyers, and stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. 

## Data Preparation
- **Outlier Treatment**: Removed outliers to prevent skewed results.
- **Missing Values**: Imputed missing values using the mean.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables using dummy encoding.

## Model Implementation
- **Multicollinearity Check**: Removed highly correlated features to improve model stability.
- **Data Scaling**: Standardized features to normalize the data.
- **Model Training**: Trained a linear regression model on the preprocessed dataset.

## Model Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Evaluated the model using RÂ², RMSE, and MAE.
- **Residual Plots**: Analyzed residuals to check for homoscedasticity and normality.

## Coefficient Interpretation
The normalized coefficient plot shows the impact of each feature on house prices:


## Conclusion
The linear regression model provides a straightforward and interpretable method for predicting house prices. The coefficient plot helps in understanding the importance of each feature.
